# ML-Asteroids-To-Be-Named

This is going to be amazing....
Just hold on

We are trying to recreate and model our own program around the NEAT algorithm. Using a game much like the aethetics of Asteroids, where you the main player fend off enemies.
The enemies logic trees are represented as neural networks, or a mathmatical topology using graph theory. THe purpose of this program is to
evolve these enemies as the game progresses to be persoannally indvidualized to defeat you and your playstyle by developing their own.

They enemies will come in waves, these waves will represent the new generations after we evolve them. Essentially the nueral nets are randomly
generated and then go under the process of evolutionwhere each neural net counts as an indvidual organism. Each indviduals organism's fitness score
is determined basically upon how long they survive multiplied by how many hits ont he player. Their life spans end once they are hit.
